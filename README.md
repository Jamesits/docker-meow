# docker-meow
~~The ultimate auto-proxy solution, now on Docker!~~

Meow original repository has been removed, so this won't work either. Regards to anyone who has tried fighting Internet censorship.

## Usage
Set ENV `PROXY=protocol://username@password:example.name:port` and you are ready to go. 

For detailed settings, set ENV `CONFIG_URL` to a valid meow_rc file URL.

See [https://github.com/renzhn/MEOW#配置](https://github.com/renzhn/MEOW#配置) for details.
